% Objective function to calculate the difference between the modelled and measured magnetic flux values due to a single pcb emitter coil.
% This is the 'Cost' function for the LM algorithm. Each iteration of LMA executes this function 8 times, once for each coil.

% currentPandO = The current position and orientation vector. This vector is the variable parameter of the objective function.
% sys          = The system object
% fluxReal     = A scaler indicating the sensed magnetic flux the sensor. 

% out          = The difference between the sensed and calculated fluxes due to a single coil
